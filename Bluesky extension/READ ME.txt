Hiiiii!

This is a program i made for opera so you can have a hyper link to bluesky! Its the entire extension file so it also works on chrome but im using opera for the instructions :)

All you have to do is
- Go to your downloads and extract the Bluesky Extension files
- Then go to your opera browser
- In the URL bar type "Opera:extensions"
- Enable developer mode if you havent already
- Find and click the button that says "Load unpacked"
- Find your unpacked file and add it (I dont know if i have to say this but, MAKE SURE you use the folder that has the manifest inside)
Then your done :)

Make sure you have fun with this and if your able to make modifications your more then welcome just credit me please :)

Have fun!
